HOW TO USE THE STUDENT MANUAL FOR COM289 Internet Programming III

INTRODUCTION
Your Student Manual is an important component of COM289 Internet Programming III. In this course, you will learn some of the foundational skills and knowledge you will need to succeed in your program in Coleman University, and in your career in information technology.

Please, read this Manual carefully, cover-to-cover. And keep the Manual close as you proceed through the course.

CONTENTS OF THE MANUAL
You will find the following in this manual:

•	The Table of Contents provides an overview of the content in and organization of, the Student Manual.
•	In the beginning of the Manual, you will find a brief description of the course, and a list of broad learning outcomes to be achieved as a result of your participation in the course. You will find also a list of learning objectives that have been established for the course. You should examine this list of objectives very carefully; in a sense, the list establishes an informal “contract” between you and your instructor, defining what, at a minimum, you will be taught in this course, and what it is expected you will learn and/or be able to demonstrate as a result of your enrollment in the course.
•	Next you will find a list of topics that will be addressed in the course. The topics are organized by lessons and topics, which represent the instructional plans for each component of the course. Look at this list carefully, in part so you will know what will be expected of you in terms of content learned.
•	You will be concerned about how you are graded in this course. The next section of the Manual, entitled “Your Grades for this Course” tells you on what basis you will be graded in the course. It’s important you have an overview of this right from the beginning.
•	Another important part of your Coleman University experience is the information resources you will learn about in the course. We’ve divided information resources into three major sections:  the first important resource is the textbook. You should, of course, read this book carefully, following the outline of topics given to you in Table 1 of this manual. The second source of information for the course is provided to you by your instructor, and may be found in the Student Manual under the heading:  Attachment 1. Here you will find information that is essential to the course, but which goes beyond what you will find in your textbook. Finally, we provide you with the URLs of some Web sites you may find useful. 
•	The section of the Manual called “Course Projects” is where you will find detailed information about your assignments for the course. Obviously, this is a critical section for you to become familiar with, for the assignments outlined in this section will be the primary basis for your grade in the course.

We hope you find this Student Manual useful. Please let us know if there ways we could improve the Manual, to make it a more effective learning tool for you. 

Thank you

Assignment Details

Lesson 2:  Create and publish a JSP and Servlet 

Project 1A: Create and publish a JSP
You are going to modify the HTML document for the Email List application, and then you will be creating a new JSP that is going to respond to that HTML document.  (Note that the HTML document contains a form with fields for the input of first name, last name, and email address, and the action attribute in the form tag currently requests the JSP of the email entry.)  In order to do that, follow these steps:

1.	Open the ch05email project in the ex_starts directory.
2.	Modify the HTML document so it has this line of text after the Email Address text box:  I’m interested in these types of music.  Next, follow this text with a list box that has options for Rock, Country, Bluegrass, and Folk music.  
3.	Once you have completed step 2, continue to modify the form so that the submit button should now submit the form to a new JSP named display_music_choices.jsp.
4.	Create a new JSP named display_music_choices.jsp that responds to the changed HTML document.  This JSP should start with an <h1> line that reads:  

Thanks for joining our email list, [first and last name].  

(Please note that the first and last name will be replaced with whatever the user enters in the first and last name field of the Email form HTML document.)
5.	This line should be followed with the following text:  

We’ll use email to notify you whenever we have new releases for these types of music:

[music list] 

(Note that the music list will display whatever the user selected in the music list box of the Email form HTML document.)  In other words, you will list the types of music that correspond to the items that are selected in the list box.
6.	Run the application

Next you are going to create a JSP that retrieves the form data and present it using JSP tags. 

Project 1B: Create and publish a Servlet
You are going to continue to modify the HTML document for the Email List application, and then you will be creating a new servlet that is going to respond to that HTML document.  (Note that the steps are similar to what you did in Project 1A.)  In order to do that, follow these steps:

1.	Open the ch06email project in the ex_starts directory.
2.	Modify the HTML document so it has this line of text after the Email Address text box:  I’m interested in these types of music.  Next, follow this text with a list box that has options for Rock, Country, Bluegrass, and Folk music.  
3.	Once you have completed step 2, continue to modify the form so that the submit button should now call a URL that’s mapped to a new servlet named DisplayMusicChoicesServlet.
4.	Create a new servlet named DisplayMusicChoicesServlet in the email package, and map this servlet to the /displayMusicChoices URL.  This servlet should respond to the changed HTML document with an <h1> line that reads:  

Thanks for joining our email list, [first and last name].  

(Please note that the first and last name will be replaced with whatever the user enters in the first and last name field of the Email form HTML document.)
5.	This line should be followed with the following text:  

We’ll use email to notify you whenever we have new releases for these types of music:

[music list] 

(Note that the music list will display whatever the user selected in the music list box of the Email form HTML document.)  In other words, you will list the types of music that correspond to the items that are selected in the list box.
6.	Make sure that the servlet only implements the doPost method, not the doGet method.  Also, make sure that the HTML page uses the HTTP Post method to request the servlet.  Last, be sure to delete any generated code that may interfere with your methods.
7.	Run the application.  Note that there is no parameter list since the HTML page uses the HTTP Post method to request the servlet.  You can test it by entering a URL that includes a parameter list.  Note that this isn’t allowed since the new servlet doesn’t implement the HTTP Get method.
8.	Add a doGet method to the servlet that calls the doPost method.
9.	Run the application.  Now test the servlet by entering a URL that includes a parameter list.  This should work correctly now that the servlet implements the doGet method.


Lesson 3:  Utilizing the Model-View-Controller Design Pattern 

Project 2: Create and publish an MVC patterned site
For this project, you’ll create a series of pages that allow you to add, update, or delete a product that’s available to the application. (Prerequisites: chapters 1-8)  Please see the Operations and the Specifications listed below.

You will create a JSP page that contains a form. The product form should contain fields for the input of product code, product description, and product price, and the action attribute in the form tag should request the Servlet described next. 

You will create a series of Servlets that will retrieve the form data and validate that each field has data stored within. If validation fails, return a JSP describing the problem and presenting the form again. Should validation succeed, present the user with a JSP that displays the entered data. Utilize a RequestDispatcher to transmit the appropriate JSP


The Index page
 
The Products page
 
The Product page
 
The Confirm Delete page
 
Operation
•	When the application starts, it displays the Index page. This page contains a link that leads to the Products page that can be used to add, update, or delete products.
•	To add a new product, the user selects the Add Product button. This displays the Product page with all text fields empty. Then, the user can fill in the text fields and click on the Update Product button to add the product.
•	To edit an existing product, the user selects the Edit link for the product. This displays the Product page with all existing data for the product displayed. Then, the user can edit any entries and click on the Update Product button to update the data for the existing product.
•	To delete a product, the user selects the Delete link for the product. This displays the Confirm Delete page. Then, if the user confirms the deletion by selecting the Yes button, the product is deleted and the Products page is displayed to reflect the new data. If the user selects the No button, the Products page is displayed.
Specifications
•	Use a Product class like the one shown later in this document to store the product data.
•	Use a ProductIO class like the one shown later in this document to read and write the product data to a text file named products.txt in the WEB-INF directory.
•	Use a text file like the products.txt file shown later in this document as a starting point for the products that are available to the application.
•	Use server-side validation to validate all user entries. In particular, make sure the user enters a code, description, and price for each product. In addition, make sure the product’s price is a valid double value.
•	Copy the Product.java, ProductIO.java, and product.txt files onto your working environment (your instructor will let you know where to get these files).

Lesson 5:  Expression Language and Java Standard Template Library 

Project 3A: Create and publish a dynamic site using EL
You are going to create an HTML page that contains a form. The form should contain fields for the input off first name, last name, and email address, and the action attribute in the form tag should request the Servlet described next. Create a Servlet that will retrieve the form data and validate that each field has data stored within. The servlet should then create a JavaBean to store the User information and place it into the Session. If validation fails, return a JSP describing the problem and presenting the form again. Use to fill the fields that did pass validation with the data sent, so that the user need only fill in the missing information. Should validation succeed, present the user with a JSP that displays the entered data using EL, and thank the user for registering with the website. Include a JSTL mechanism to present a customer service phone number should the day correspond to a non-weekend. Utilize a RequestDispatcher to transmit the appropriate JSP.

1.	Open the ch10download project in the ex_starts directory.  Then run the application to make sure it works correctly.
2.	Open the CheckUserServlet and the RegisterUserServlet classes in the download package and note that they store the User and Product objects as attributes of the session object.
3.	Open the download.jsp page for each product.  Then use EL instead of the standard JSP tags to access the code and description properties of the Product bean that’s stored in the session object.
4.	Test the application
5.	Now open the index.jsp file.  Then delete the scriptlet code that’s used to retrieve the cookie for the user’s first name; use EL to access the cookie for the user’s first name; and display a message “Welcome back, firstname” at the top of the page.  Please note that this welcome message will only be displayed correctly if the cookie exists.
6.	Test the application to make sure it works correctly.

Project 3B: Create and publish a dynamic site using JSTL
1.	Open the ch11download project in the ex_starts directory.  Then run the application.
2.	Use your IDE to add the JSTL library to this project.  With NetBeans, you can do that by right clicking on the Libraries folder for the project and selecting the Add Libraries command from the resulting menu.
3.	Open the JSPs for this project.  Then add the taglib directive for the core JSTL library to the beginning of these pages.  Finally, use the url tag to encode all the URLs in this application.
4.	Test the application to make sure it works correctly.
5.	Open the index.jsp file.  Then modify it so it uses the if tag to only display the welcome message if the cookie for the first name doesn’t contain a null value.
6.	Test the application to make sure it works correctly.

LESSON 1: JAVA WEB PROGRAMMING AND TOMCAT

Topic 1:  Delivering Web Content

At the core of web application development is the fundamental exchange of messages between a client and a server. It is essential to bear in mind that underlying the layers of processing the programmer is still relying upon the exchange of messages between client and server. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) defines several message types, but the message types of interest for the majority of JSP is GET and POST. 

As per its protocol definition, GET is a request for an available asset, including web pages, images, files, and more. POST serves the purpose of delivering client-provided information to a server in the form of name-value pairs called parameters. In practice, GET and POST can be, and often are, used interchangeably. GET and POST messages are requests; that is, transmissions sent from the client to the server. The server processes the request and returns a response message to the client. 

 
Requests can include client-provided information, and responses typically contain a web page or file specified in the request. Static resources are generally sent without server processing. Dynamic web development involves tailoring the server’s response to the client that requested the resource in some fashion.

Topic 2: Tomcat Purpose and Design

Tomcat is Apache’s implementation of a JSP and Servlet Engine. Configuration files are housed within the “conf” directory, and binary files to start and stop the server are located within the “bin” directory. Web applications are placed within the “WebApps” directory; the simplest method for deploying an application from an IDE is to export it as a WAR (Web Archive) file. Place the WAR file into WebApps, and Tomcat will automatically unpack and deploy the web application.

LESSON 3: MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER (MVC) DESIGN PATTERN

The Model-View-Controller Design Pattern divides program responsibilities among components to ease development and maintenance of applications. 

•	Model: Defined by abstract data types, to manage application information in a structure separate from presentation and business logic activities. JavaBeans are commonly used to represent data within an application. JavaBeans will be explored more fully in the next lesson. 
•	View: Presentation layer of the application, providing an interface for the application user. The view should be designed with modularity in mind, so that changes to the view can be performed without requiring modifications to the model or controller. This role is most efficiently filled by Java Server Pages.
•	Controller: The business logic component. Servlets serve as effective vehicles for business logic; Java code does not need to be encapsulated within special tags, which leads to clear, concise code.

LESSON 4: JAVABEANS AND STANDARD JSP TAGS

Topic 1: JavaBeans 

A JavaBean is a Java Class, and commonly represents data managed by the web application. JavaBeans should be familiar to students that have programmed in Java before. To be considered a JavaBean, a Java class must adhere to the following constraints:

•	It must define a default (zero-argument) constructor.
•	It must define “set” and “get” methods for each instance variable that is to be accessible as a JSP property, or an “is” in the case of a Boolean accessor. 
•	No instance variables may be declared public. 


Topic 2: Standard JSP Tags 

Standard JSP tags provide HTML-styled tags to interact with JavaBean objects, eliminating the need to include explicit Java code within a JSP. This technology has been replaced in favor of the next topic; nonetheless, standard JSP tags currently exist in a great deal of existing web applications.

Topic 3: Expression Language

Expression Language provides a concise syntax to include dynamic content within a JSP, replacing the more verbose Standard JSP tag. EL also provides the capability to perform operations within it. An important distinction between Standard JSP tags and EL is that the former, when referencing a JavaBean that has not been instantiated, will instantiate the JavaBean for subsequent use. In EL, the programmer must ensure that the JavaBean or other referenced object is in existence within one of the defined scopes when referenced.

LESSON 5: JAVA STANDARD TEMPLATE LIBRARY

The JSTL is a set of prebuilt libraries that provide tags for a variety of tasks to be performed within the body of a JSP. The libraries are organized into Jar (Java Archive) files, which must be made available to the web application before the JSTL tags can be used. The process varies according to Tomcat deployment, choice of IDE, and other considerations. The development environment provided to the student will be configured appropriately; if you wish to use your own environment, consult the Sun site and the supporting documentation.

It is necessary to include a taglib directive to make the core JSTL accessible within a JSP. Additional directives are required to include the extended libraries, which include Formatting, SQL, XML, and Functions.

LESSON 6: CUSTOM TAGS

Should JSP tags, Standard Tags, Expression Language and JSTL fail to provide the tools needed to streamline JSP development, a framework is available to create customized tags that Tomcat can translate into dynamic content. A Tag Library Descriptor is an XML file that links TagHandler classes to the tags found within a JSP. It is necessary to include a taglib directive to instruct Tomcat to parse the TLD.

The Enterprise package javax.servlet.jsp.tagext provides full descriptions of the tag lifecycle in the API specifications of the Tag and BodyTag interfaces. Custom tag classes support standalone tags, tags that support enclosed content, and iterating tags.

LESSON 7: JAVA DATABASE CONNECTIVITY, MYSQL AND JAVA SQL

Topic 1: JDBC 

Several drivers are defined for Java Database Connectivity. The package java.sql provides a set of classes used to interact with a given database. A database developer or a third party provides the driver. The programmer loads the driver as a class, which provides the methods necessary to deliver queries and statements to the database. The examples in this course rely upon the MySQL database management system. Chapter 13 serves as a reference for common SQL tasks. Visit the MySQL website to learn more about the Connector/j database driver. 

Topic 2: SQL in Java

While it is possible to use concatenation to create SQL statements and queries that rely upon user-input values, this practice is vulnerable to SQL injection (a term that describes subverting the intended SQL statement purpose to access protected information or server resources not generally available). It is acceptable to utilize Statement objects for activities that do not accept user input, but using the PreparedStatement enhances efficiency and security and is the preferable mechanism. 

Database connection pooling can be utilized to increase web application performance. Limiting the number of times that objects must instantiated to interact with the database, as well as throttling the number of queries and statements the database management system will be handling at a given time, produces the efficiency gain. A database access attempt is blocked if no connection objects are available at the time of request. The attempt will be unblocked and allowed to continue processing upon release of a connection for use by another request. The Jakarta project includes a ConnectionPool class to manage a collection of connection objects; consult the textbook for installation instructions.

LESSON 8: SECURE SOCKET LAYER, RESTRICTING WEBSITE RESOURCES

Topic 1: SSL 

This discussion covers the process of creating a certificate and serving webpages via a secure connection. It should be understood that browsers will not trust a certificate created this way, and will report that it is not trusted to the end user. Legitimate providers of certificates charge fees to provide their services; because of this, it is more common for businesses to provide legitimate certificates rather than individuals for the purpose of identity authentication. 


Topic 2: Secure Socket Layer, restricting website resources

Tomcat provides several options for restricting access to site content from unauthorized users. It is also worth noting that the developer can institute access management without using the utilities provided by Tomcat.

LESSON 9: LISTENERS AND FILTERS

Topic 1: Tomcat Listeners

The ServletContext, HttpSession, and ServletRequest interfaces and supporting classes are available to allow for the server to respond to events that occur application-wide. Note that this category of listeners is registered through the Web.XML configuration file rather than via a method provided by a particular class interface.
